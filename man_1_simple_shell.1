This variable, when and only when an interactive shell is invoked, shall
be subjected to parameter expansion (see Section 2.6.2, Parameter
Expansion) by the shell and the resulting value shall be used as a
pathname of a file containing shell commands to execute in the current
environment.
The file need not be executable.
If the expanded value of ENV is not an absolute pathname, the results
are unspecified.
ENV shall be ignored if the real and effective user IDs or real and
effective group IDs of the process are different.
.TP
.B \f[I]PATH\f[R]

Standard input and standard error are the files that determine whether a
shell is interactive mode.
.TP
.B Interactive mode:
While having executed this simple shell, type directly into the command
line and press enter.
ls \-la
.TP
.B Non Interactive mode:
While outside of this shell, make a command or file and pipe it into the
standard input.
echo ls \-la | ./hsh
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The shell can also be called from a script this way:
.PP
echo \[lq]./example\[rq] | ./hsh
.PP
where example is:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
#!/bin/bash
.PD 0
.P
.PD
echo ejemplo
.PP
This will print into the standard output: \[lq]ejemplo\[rq]
